# Pulse Coupled Neural Netwrok (PCNN) with Remote Sensing Image
This project can be divided in several parts. Short descriptions are given below. All the necessary and detailed documentation is added with the notebook corresponding cells.

### Module 1: Remote Sensing MODIS Data
Primarily the data folder containing a .hdf file which is downloaded from NASA LAADS DAAC.
This file is MODIS Terra satellite .hdf file which contains lots of metadata. The used hdf file should be downloaded from the NASA website as this file is huge in size.

### Basic PCNN
This data is used by PCNN for visualization and oscillation of the model.

### Image Fusion with Improved PCNN
This data is used by PCNN for visualization and oscillation of the model.
